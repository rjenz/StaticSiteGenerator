# StaticSiteGenrator

A simple but strongly opinionated static site generator using [Scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban) and [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig).
Build in C# to help me with the maintenance of my Websites.
[WebsiteTemplate](https://github.com/rjenz/WebsiteTemplate) implements most features this generator provides.

I wanted to take a break from game dev for a couple of weekends and just started this for the fun of starting a fresh project. Please do not use it, there a many more capable and flexible projects out there.
